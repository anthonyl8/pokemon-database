# Pokemon Game Management Database System

## Project Description

The application is meant to be a Pokemon game management lookup system. The database models Pokemon species as well as individual Pokemon. Each Pokemon species has one or two types, can learn certain moves (which also have their own types), can have certain abilities, may evolve into another species, and has one specific egg group. Each individual Pokemon knows up to 4 moves, has a certain ability, and is owned by a trainer as part of the trainer's Pokemon collection. A trainer can be a regular NPC trainer, or they can be either a player character or a gym leader. The database also models locations, where trainers, Pokemon species, and items are found in the game.
